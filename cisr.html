        <h2>Cisco Recruitment Process</h2>
        <p>Every year, hundreds of candidates face the Cisco interview process. The candidates who have better knowledge of the concepts of networking, excellent analytical skills, and computer intelligence can easily clear the interview at Cisco.</p>
        
        <h1>1. Interview Process</h1>
        <p>Usually, the interview process at Cisco involves the following three rounds:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Online Assessment Test</li>
            <li>Technical Interview Rounds</li>
            <li>HR Interview</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For experienced candidates also, the Cisco interview rounds will normally remain the same. But in the case of a few major roles, you may be asked to appear for two or more rounds of technical interviews preceded by an HR interview.</p>
        
        <h1>2. Interview Rounds</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Online Assessment Test:</strong> This online assessment test consists of the following sections with no negative marking:
                <ul>
                    <li>Aptitude Test: Questions around Probability, Permutations and Combinations, Algebra, Simple & Compound Interest, Number Series, Profit and Loss, etc.</li>
                    <li>Technical Test: Questions around Computer Networking, C, Algorithms, Data Structures as well as digital electronics, CMOS and Microprocessor, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical Interview Rounds:</strong> In the technical interview rounds, the interviewer may ask questions on various Computer fundamentals like Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Algorithms, Database Management, Networking etc. Candidates will be tested in terms of in-depth knowledge in all the aspects of domains related to Computer Science and Networking. Other technical questions are normally asked from the projects or internships mentioned in the CV. The company primarily focuses on a candidateâ€™s approach towards a particular problem.</li>
            <li><strong>HR Interview:</strong> In this round, HR will usually question you about the job role, why do you want to join Cisco, the most challenging project that you were involved in, etc. Here the questions will be majorly asked from your CV. Overall, you are required to be prepared well before this interview round and have a fair knowledge of Cisco and the stream from which you have got graduated/experienced.</li>
