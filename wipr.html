                        <h1>HR Interview Round</h1>
                        <p>Every organization conducts an HR interview round to assess your personality, strengths, shortcomings, and ability to handle the task, as well as to assess your background and determine if you're the ideal fit for this position. Key points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review your resume to ensure all relevant information is included and accurate.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Please tell me about yourself. (This is the very first question, and it will almost certainly be asked in each round of the interview. Telling the interviewer about your hobbies, skill sets, strengths, qualifications, and successes is the ideal method to answer this question. Start with your current position, achievements, past work history, and academic and personal details if you're an experienced professional.)</li>
                            <li>What is your expectation with respect to this role?</li>
                            <li>Why are you interested in working for Wipro?</li>

                            <li>Tell me about your internships and projects.</li>
                            <li>Why are you looking for a job change? (This is a popular question among experienced professionals looking for a change. The simplest way to respond to this question is to say that you are leaving your current job to pursue a promotion. Make sure you don't criticize or undermine the company where you're now employed.)</li>
